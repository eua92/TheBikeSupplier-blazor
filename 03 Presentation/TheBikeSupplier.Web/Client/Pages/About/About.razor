            <p>
                The Bike Supplier was launched back in early 2010 in the city of Amsterdam as a simple bike
                rental shop. Our passion for cycling combined with our desire to provide high-quality services
                led to our expansion to retail. Since 2013 we offer a wide variety of more than 20 bike brands,
                new or used. Moreover our collection includes many different types of bicycles from simple
                road bikes and children's bikes to mountain and electric ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our biggest dream though was to bring people who love cycling together and explore the beauties
                of Netherlands. That's the reason that in 2017 we started organising cycling tour in the city
                of Amsterdam as well as the rest of the country.

            <p>
                We launched our web services in 2015 as a way to serve as many people as possible. Visitors of
                our e-shop can view our products and services, order and pay for their bike online, and make a
                reservation for one of our tours.
